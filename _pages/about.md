I am a passionate Mechanical and Aerospace Engineer with a strong focus on developing and applying large-scale computational methods to solve complex challenges in fluid dynamics and aerospace design. My primary interests lie in turbulence modeling, shock structure simulations, and design parameter optimization for advanced aircraft systems. Currently, I am engaged in research on hypersonic velocity field detection, leveraging computational tools to analyze high-speed flow phenomena, which are critical for understanding and improving the performance of hypersonic vehicles.

My technical skills include expertise in MATLAB, COMSOL, Python, SolidWorks, and Finite Element Analysis (FEA), with a specialization in high-fidelity simulations and multiphysics modeling. I am deeply committed to pushing the boundaries of aerodynamic analysis and optimization, aiming to improve performance, reliability, and efficiency for next-generation aerospace systems.

Looking ahead, my goal is to develop innovative computational frameworks that simulate fluid-structure interactions and propulsion systems under extreme hypersonic conditions. These advancements will play a key role in designing robust and efficient hypersonic aircraft and spacecraft, contributing to the future of space exploration and high-speed transportation. By bridging simulation, modeling, and real-world applications, I strive to drive innovation in the aerospace industry and help overcome the challenges of operating in extreme environments.
